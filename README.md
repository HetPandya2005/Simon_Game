# Simon Game - JavaScript Memory Game

This is a web-based Simon Game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges the user's memory by generating a growing sequence of colors that the user must repeat correctly. With each level, the sequence becomes longer, testing memory and attention to detail.

## Live Demo


## How the Game Works

- Press any key to begin the game.
- The game will display a sequence by highlighting a colored button and playing a corresponding sound.
- Your task is to click the buttons in the exact same order.
- After every user click, the game checks whether the input matches the sequence so far.
  - If your input is correct, the game continues.
  - If you make a mistake, the game ends.
- You can restart the game by pressing any key after a game over.
